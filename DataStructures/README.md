# Data Structures

Here will put the data structures that I have learned and implemented.

## Common Data Structures

Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and worked with efficiently. They define the relationship between the data, and the operations that can be performed on the data.

7 common data structures:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- HashMaps
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
