# Algorithm

Here will put the algorithm that I have learned and implemented.

## Sorting Algorithm

Sorting algorithms are a set of instructions that take an array or list as an input and arrange the items into a particular order. The output can be in non-decreasing, non-increasing, or any other predefined order.

6 common sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

## Searching Algorithm

Searching algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored. Based on the type of search operation, these algorithms are generally classified into two categories:

4 common searching algorithms:

- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search

## Greedy Algorithm

Greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the intent of finding a global optimum.

## Graph Algorithm

Graph algorithms are a significant part of the algorithmic landscape and are critical for solving a variety of problems. Graphs are a flexible data structure that can be used to represent a variety of different problems.

## Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable to problems exhibiting the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
