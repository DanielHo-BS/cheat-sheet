# Sorting Algroithm

## Introduction

Sorting algorithms are a set of instructions that take an array or list as an input and arrange the items into a particular order. The output can be in non-decreasing, non-increasing, or any other predefined order.

## Time Complexity

| Algorithm | Best | Average | Worst | Space |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bubble Sort | O(n) | O(n^2) | O(n^2) | O(1) |
| Selection Sort | O(n^2) | O(n^2) | O(n^2) | O(1) |
| Insertion Sort | O(n) | O(n^2) | O(n^2) | O(1) |
| Merge Sort | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n) |
| Quick Sort | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n^2) | O(log n) |
| Heap Sort | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(1) |


## Rule of Thumb

```text
10^9 operations per second
```

For example, if the time limit is 1 second, then the maximum size of the array can be sorted using O(n log n) algorithm is 10^8.
