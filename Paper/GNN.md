Deep Learning on Graphs:

* Graph Recurrent Neural Networks

  * GRU and LSTM
  * Node-Level RNNs
  * Graph-Level RNNs


* Graph Convolutional Networks

  * Convolution Operations

    * Speatral convolutions: using the graph Laplacian matrix.
    * Spatial convolutions: speatral function which is polynomial or first-order is equivalent to a spatial convolution.
    * From multistep neighbors to the immediate neighbors.
  
  * Readout opearations

    * Simple statistic: averaging or summation
    * Hierarchial clustering algorithms jointly trained
    * Adding pseudo node or imposing a node have been investigated.

* Grapsh Autoencoders

* Graph Reinforcement Learning

* Graph Adverarial Methods
